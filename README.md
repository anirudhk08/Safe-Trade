# Safe-Trade
This project is about a miniature stock exchange. A stock exchange is an organization for trading shares in publicly owned companies.  The stock exchange system keeps track of buy and sell orders placed by traders and automatically executes orders when the highest “bid” price to buy stock meets the lowest asking price for that stock. Orders to buy stock at a certain price (or lower) or to sell stock at a certain price (or higher) are called “limit” orders. There are also “market” orders: to buy at the currently offered lowest asking price or to sell at the currently offered highest bid price.
